## Usage

It's a wrapper around [spatie/schema-org](https://github.com/spatie/schema-org) that turns it into a site method, used like this:

```
<?= $site->schema('LocalBusiness')
  ->name('Hash&Salt')
  ->email('email@example.com')
  ->contactPoint($page->schema('contactPoint')
  ->areaServed('Worldwide')
  ) ?>

It supports anything thats in the [RDFa spec](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/blob/master/data/schema.rdfa) for structured data which is about 600 data points. Refer to [schema.org site](http://schema.org/docs/schemas.html) for details on each bit. Go nuts :)
